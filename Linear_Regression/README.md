# Linear Regression

## Overview
Implemented **simple linear regression from scratch** to understand how model parameters are optimized using both **gradient descent** and the **normal equation**.

## Key Learnings
- Built a linear regression model **without external ML libraries**.  
- Implemented **manual gradient descent**.  
- Explored the **normal equation** for analytical parameter estimation.  
- Gained intuition for **feature scaling** and its effect on convergence.  
- Visualized training behavior and evaluated performance on test data.
