# Linear Regression

## Project Summary

In this project, I implemented simple linear regression models **from scratch** to better understand the fundamentals behind optimization methods and model fitting.  
The goal was to explore both **manual gradient descent** and the **normal equation** approach for parameter estimation.

## What I Learned

- Implementing a **linear regression model** without relying on external machine learning libraries.  
- Designing a **manual gradient descent** algorithm that iteratively minimizes a loss function.  
- Building intuition for how the **loss function** affects parameter updates and model accuracy.  
- Using the **normal equation** to compute model parameters analytically.  
- Understanding the importance of **feature scaling** to prevent certain parameters from dominating the optimization process.  
- Structuring a standard machine learning workflow:  
  - Extract relevant features  
  - Train the model using a training set
  - Using matplotlib to visualize what happens during and after training  
  - Evaluate and predict on a test set
