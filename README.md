# Machine Learning From Scratch

**Machine Learning From Scratch** is a collection of projects exploring the core principles and practical implementation of machine learning using **Python**, **Numpy**, **Scikit-learn** and **PyTorch**.  
The repository bridges **theoretical understanding** with **hands-on experimentation**, emphasizing how fundamental concepts such as gradient descent, loss functions, and regularization translate into PyTorch’s modular, differentiable framework.

Each project focuses on a specific algorithm or concept — from linear and logistic regression to early neural network structures — implemented with both **manual computation** and **PyTorch automation**.  
This dual approach provides a clear view of what happens under the hood of modern machine learning libraries while building strong intuition for model design, optimization, and evaluation.
