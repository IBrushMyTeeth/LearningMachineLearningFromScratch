# Multi-class Logistic Regression — Iris Dataset

## Overview
Implemented **multi-class logistic regression** on the **Iris dataset** using **PyTorch**, extending binary classification concepts to handle three output classes.

## Key Learnings
- Applied the **softmax function** for multi-class probability outputs.  
- Interpreted model performance using a **confusion matrix** and **ROC curves (one-vs-rest)**.  
- Learned how PyTorch structures and optimizes multi-class classification tasks.  
- Gained deeper intuition for how **logistic regression generalizes** to multiple categories.
