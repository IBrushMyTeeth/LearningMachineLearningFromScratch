## Objectives

- Learn the **concepts** behind binary classification and logistic regression.  
- Practice building a complete machine learning workflow:
  - Data loading and splitting  
  - Feature scaling  
  - Model training and evaluation  
  - Making predictions  
- Implement the workflow inside a **single class** (`BreastCancerClassifier`) for clean, reusable code.

---

## Features

- Loads the Breast Cancer dataset from `scikit-learn`
- Scales features 
- Trains a **logistic regression** model
- Evaluates model performance with **accuracy** and **confusion matrix**
- Encapsulated in a single class for simplicity and structure
