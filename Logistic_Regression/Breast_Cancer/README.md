# Binary Classification — Breast Cancer Dataset

## Overview
Built a **logistic regression classifier** in **PyTorch** to predict breast cancer presence using the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset**.  
The focus was on understanding ** binary cross entropy loss ** while transitioning from manual gradient descent to **PyTorch’s automatic differentiation**.

## Key Learnings
- Understood logistic regression as a **probabilistic classifier** using the **sigmoid function**.  
- Implemented **cross-entropy loss** manually, then used PyTorch’s `nn.Module` and `torch.optim`.  
- Improved model performance through **learning rate tuning** and **regularization (L1, L2)**.  
- Developed better debugging habits for **tensor shape management** and **training stability**.  
- Strengthened understanding of the **link between cross-entropy and maximum likelihood**.
