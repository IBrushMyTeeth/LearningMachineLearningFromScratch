# Logistic Regression

This folder contains several projects exploring logistic regression with PyTorch, covering both binary and multi-class classification.

## Overview
These experiments focus on understanding logistic regression as a probabilistic model, how PyTorch handles automatic differentiation, and how loss functions like binary cross entropy and cross entropy connect to maximum likelihood. The projects build from binary classification to multi-class settings, with an emphasis on clarity, stability, and proper evaluation.

## Key Learnings 
- Used sigmoid and softmax functions to model output probabilities.  
- Implemented cross-entropy loss manually and with PyTorch’s built-in modules.  
- Explored optimization with `torch.optim`, learning rate tuning, and L1/L2 regularization.  
- Improved debugging and tensor shape management during training.  
- Evaluated models using confusion matrices, ROC curves, and class-wise performance.

More experiments will be added as the logistic regression collection grows.
